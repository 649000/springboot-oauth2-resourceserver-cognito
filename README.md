## Endpoints
|          | localhost                                   | Railway                                                     |

| Open API | http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html | https://warranty-tracker-api.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html |
| Actuator | http://localhost:8080/actuator              | https://warranty-tracker-api.onrender.com/actuator              |

Note that endpoints are secured by Spring Security and require a valid JWT access token to be called. Only the `/actuator` and `/swagger-ui/**` endpoints are not secured. 

Service on Render may be down due to limited uptime hours provided.

## Reflection

This project bears resemblance to the [Subtracker project](https://github.com/649000/subtracker-rest-api) I previously worked on. Here, I've integrated AWS Cognito, an Identity as a Service solution offered by AWS. The primary objective was to acquaint myself with AWS services, which play a crucial role in my preparation for the AWS certification.
