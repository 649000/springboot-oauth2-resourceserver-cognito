## Reflection

This project is similar to the [Subtracker project](https://github.com/649000/subtracker-rest-api) I worked on. In this project, I am using AWS Cognito which is AWS' offering of Identity as a Service. The aim was to familiarise with AWS services which aid in my learning for my AWS certification.
